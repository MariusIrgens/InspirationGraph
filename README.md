# Importance-driven focus+context for inspiration analysis in citation graphs
This is application study code for a paper I wrote at University of Bergen, autumn 2022. The paper is available as a .pdf in the root folder. 

You have to download the API's and add them to a folder called "lib", one step above the root folder. Alternatively, you can just change the paths of the imports at the top (and the src="" url in the index.html).

If you have any questions, send me a message. I would be glad to help!
